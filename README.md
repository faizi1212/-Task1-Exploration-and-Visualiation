# -Task1-Exploration-and-Visualiation

Overview This project focuses on loading, inspecting, and visualizing the famous Iris dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The goal is to understand the dataset structure, visualize relationships, and detect outliers.

📂 Files in Repository Task1.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing code and visualizations for Iris dataset analysis.

🛠️ Requirements To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:

bash Copy Edit pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib 📋 Steps Performed Load the Dataset

Used sns.load_dataset("iris") to load the built-in Iris dataset.

Inspect the Dataset

Checked shape, column names, first few rows, data types, and summary statistics.

Scatter Plot

Plotted Petal Length vs Petal Width with species as hue to see class separation.

Histograms

Created histograms for each feature to analyze distributions.

Outlier Detection

Used boxplots to visually detect any outliers in the dataset.

📊 Visualizations Scatter plot: Shows clear separation between species based on petal features.

Histograms: Provide insight into distribution of each variable.

Boxplots: Identify any anomalies in data values.

▶️ Running the Notebook Open the file in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.

Run each cell sequentially.

Visualizations will appear inline.
